# DBR_spectra
A python package to simulate spectra and fresnel quantities of stratified media

Author: Renu Raman Sahu
These library files compute the electric fields and spectrum by using the transfer matrix methods.


spectrum_and_fields_s_polarisation.py

1) Run this file by
    python spectrum_and_fields_s_polarisation.py
2) This will plot the spectrum in matplotlib canvas. The x-axis shows the wavelength in nm.
2) Clicking on canvas takes the wavelength as input and plots the spatial distribution of  relative electric field intensity of that wavelength along with the refractive index.
